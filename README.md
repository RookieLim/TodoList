    ✔️ We worked in communication through the whole process.
   <br> ✔️ I checked the information update status in real time while writing it myself.
   <br> ✔️ Through code review, we tell each other what we don't know and fill in the gaps.
   <br> ✔️ We provide feedback on the code through video meeting.
   <br> ✔️ Increase work efficiency by coordinating work hours with each other.
